# Object-Classification-Using-Tensorflow-Lite
Classification of objects and deploying it on a Android Cell Phone.

Created a dataset of household objects by clicking 700 images consisting of 10 different object classes.
Trained the neural network on this dataset using EfficientNet-Lite model.
Converted it to Tensorflow Lite format in order to run it on the cellphone.
Deployed it on my Android phone using Android Studio.
